        <h2>Management Approach</h2>
        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>From the beginning of a project, we respect the need for absolute privacy.</p>
        <h4>Communications</h4>
        <p>
          We understand the importance of timely, thorough, and well-documented communications 
          for the client, the interior design team, and particularly the shipyard. Throughout every 
          step of the project, we provide thorough and timely documentation including AutoCAD drawings and meeting notes.
        </p>
        <h4>Documentation</h4>
        <p>
          We pride ourselves on providing outstanding technical documentation, including proactive details such as 
          color-coding to ensure comprehension across language barriers.
        </p>
        <h4>Attention</h4>
        <p>
          Our availability and flexibility are critical when working on projects of this caliber. We have first-hand 
          experience in the idiosyncrasies of building a boat, and a proven track record in providing ongoing support.
        </p>
        <h4>Personal Attention</h4>
        <p>
          Steve Segall is not only the president of our company, he is a hands-on project manager and engineer who 
          will be directly involved in your project from beginning to end.

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <p>
          "Over the years, our company has worked with a number of A/V firms, and we believe Audio Video Concepts 
          and Design to be one of the top firms in the world. Their attention to detail, high quality design, excellent 
          communications and exceptional customer service help us to simplify the construction and outfitting process, 
          even at yards that do not have a large engineering department. Most important, the company's management listens 
          carefully to their customers' requirements and works closely with them to provide the level of complexity and 
          sophistication that meets their needs while remaining conscious of whatever budget has been established."

          "My first experience with AV Concepts and Designs was on a very well known super yacht, in which they were 
          installing a complete recording studio, lighting system, and extraordinary TV system. When I saw the caliber 
          of their installation, wiring, and aboard systems work, I was extremely impressed. Now, years later, I regularly 
          have the pleasure of working directly with them on some of the projects in our yard. In addition to their 
          unmatched quality of workmanship, I have witnessed the level of personal service they provide — going out of 
          their way to make sure everything is done right, and providing outstanding, professional customer and boat yard 
          support from design through installation."

          able to put our name next to yours when corresponding to potential clients. Thank you again to you and your team 
          for job well done."

        <p>"After several years of struggling with our existing equipment and service providers, my call to Steve and his 
          crew has resulted in my rescue from "AV HELL" by delivering reliable and solid system components, coupled with 
          exceptional customer and technical support. As we continue to expand the scope of our project, I look forward 
          to working with AVCD, confident that we will continue to build on their successes in the coming months and years."
