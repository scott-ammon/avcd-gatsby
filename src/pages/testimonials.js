      "Over the years, our company has worked with a number of A/V firms, and we believe Audio Video Concepts 
      and Design to be one of the top firms in the world. Their attention to detail, high quality design, excellent 
      communications and exceptional customer service help us to simplify the construction and outfitting process, 
      even at yards that do not have a large engineering department. Most important, the company's management listens 
      carefully to their customers' requirements and works closely with them to provide the level of complexity and 
      sophistication that meets their needs while remaining conscious of whatever budget has been established."

      "My first experience with AV Concepts and Designs was on a very well known super yacht, in which they were 
      installing a complete recording studio, lighting system, and extraordinary TV system. When I saw the caliber 
      of their installation, wiring, and aboard systems work, I was extremely impressed. Now, years later, I regularly 
      have the pleasure of working directly with them on some of the projects in our yard. In addition to their 
      unmatched quality of workmanship, I have witnessed the level of personal service they provide — going out of 
      their way to make sure everything is done right, and providing outstanding, professional customer and boat yard 
      support from design through installation."

    <p>"After several years of struggling with our existing equipment and service providers, my call to Steve and his 
      crew has resulted in my rescue from "AV HELL" by delivering reliable and solid system components, coupled with 
      exceptional customer and technical support. As we continue to expand the scope of our project, I look forward 
      to working with AVCD, confident that we will continue to build on their successes in the coming months and years."
